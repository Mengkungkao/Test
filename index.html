  You've reached the stage of life where: 
_ reading book is a must
_ sleep is better than Friday-night party
_ study hard is necessary but don't forget what your real passion is
_ people usually come and go, so don't worry
_ you don't need to force people if they wanna be a part of your life 
_ silence is the best answer for almost every situation 
_ believe less on luck 
_ people just come to your when they need you 
_ you have the least reaction with everything 
_ you just wanna pass the exam 
_ the only way to stop people from saying is to let them win
_ you appreciate what's yours 
_ need and want can be differentiated 
_ you don't force something if it's not meant to be
_ happiness is when you can help people
_ judge somthing in first sight is totally wrong
_ the obstacles are always harder, but you also know that you are getting stronger
_ actions are better than words, so stop talking and start doing
_ sometimes, wrong choice leads to the best destination 
_ you use dU=Î´W+Î´Q instead of Î´Q=dU+Î´W ðŸ˜’
